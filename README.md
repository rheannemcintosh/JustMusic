# JustMusic :musical_note:

## Project Overview
JustMusic is a prototype for a music streaming application, built using Vue.js. The application is based off a tutorial by the Zero to Mastery Academy which can be accessed [here](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/learn-vue-js). This was developed as part of my **365 Days of Code Challenge**.

## Initial Work
The initial work is still underway, but currently the application uses Vue.js and Firebase.
